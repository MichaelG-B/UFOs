# UFOs

## Overview
- As with many industries, sometimes a good way to showcase one's work is to create a webpage that will host it. For this project a webpage was created for a journalist documenting UFO sightings in her hometown. She wanted to provide a webpage that could filter the database of sightings she created in order for readers to gain a more nuanced picture of the various sightings based on their own interests.

### Resources Utilized to Complete Analysis
- HTML, Javascript ES6+, CSS, Bootstrap, D3
  
## Results
- Our final composition of the webpage included the journalist's article about the UFO sightings, a table highlighting the sightings data with columns showing the date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and any comments associated with a particular sighting. The webpage also includes a filter dashboard whereby readers could filter the table via date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO sighting.
- Initial webpage
- https://github.com/MichaelG-B/UFOs/blob/5f68b4a1724f8dd8b59e2e1c8d14ecd10265f125/Initial%20webpage.png
- The initial webpage looks like the image above when it loads up. In order to filter the results navigate to the left hand side of the webpage and identify which filter you would like to use to alter the table date.
- One filter
- https://github.com/MichaelG-B/UFOs/blob/5f68b4a1724f8dd8b59e2e1c8d14ecd10265f125/One%20filter%20search.png
- You may now change the results of the table based on onefilter like the image above which will alter the table to provide results based on the filter.
- Multiple filters
- https://github.com/MichaelG-B/UFOs/blob/5f68b4a1724f8dd8b59e2e1c8d14ecd10265f125/multiple%20filter%20search.png
- You may also utilize multiple filters like the image above which will alter the table results based on those filters
- Once you have implemented your chosen filters the page will display the results in the table on the right of the webpage.

## Summary
- One of the major drawbacks of the webpage itself is that it only has data from a specific year, 2010 instead of capturing live sightings as they occur over the years, essentially it lacks a robustness in its data capture and thereby its usability as an active UFO sightings database with filters.
- I would like to suggest two recommendations other than creating an up to date active datebase. 
- First, I would recommend that the site implement another filter based on duration of the sighting, I understand that not every duration row is similar or even in a standard numeric format but it may interest readers as to how long these sightings occured.
- Second, I would recommend that the site try its best to edit the comments column in order to get a standard for how the comments are written that way readers may be able to filter the comments better knowing they all follow a similar structure.
